## Overview

**FreshHarvest Logistics** is a leading cold warehouse provider in California, sourcing select locally grown fruits from nearby farmers and delivering them to premium supermarkets. Their high-end clientele demands *near-perfect freshness*, with a service level where even **one defective fruit per thousand is unacceptable**.

To meet this standard, we developed an **AI-powered freshness inspection system** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Transfer Learning**. The system detects overripe or spoiled fruits from conveyor belt images and alerts manual checkers, reducing human error and improving efficiency.

---

## Key Features

- **CNN-Based Quality Control**: Detects fresh vs. spoiled fruits across 8 categories.
- **Two-Phase Model Training**:  
  1. Baseline CNN model (no transfer learning, no regularization)  
  2. Optimized ResNet50 transfer learning model with regularization & hyperparameter tuning  
- **Real-Time Demo App**: Interactive Streamlit app with drag-and-drop image classification.
- **End-to-End Pipeline**:
  - Data ingestion & augmentation
  - Dataset splitting (train/val/test)
  - Model training, optimization, and saving
  - Deployment-ready prediction API
- **Supports 8 Fruits**: Banana, Lemon, Lulo, Mango, Orange, Strawberry, Tamarillo, Tomato — each classified as *Fresh* or *Spoiled*.
